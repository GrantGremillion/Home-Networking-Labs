# Home-Networking-Labs

## About This Lab Series
This repository contains a series of hands-on home networking labs I am completing for personal growth and professional development in the field of networking. My goal is to deepen my practical understanding of networking technologies, devices, and configurations through real-world lab scenarios.

These labs serve as a self-directed learning path where I build foundational skills working with Cisco routers, switches, and related network equipment. This experiential approach helps me bridge the gap between theory and practice.



## Purpose and Motivation
* To gain practical, hands-on experience configuring and troubleshooting real networking devices and protocols.

* To prepare for industry certifications, specifically the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam.

* To build a solid portfolio showcasing my networking skills and lab projects for potential employers.

* To explore various networking concepts in a structured and repeatable manner.

* To develop confidence in managing network hardware and software configurations.



## How to Use This Repository
* Each lab is organized into its own folder/wiki page with detailed steps, configurations, and explanations.

* Configuration commands and troubleshooting notes are included to document the learning process.

* Diagrams and screenshots support visual understanding.

* I created this repository primarily for my own learning and reference, but it is designed so that anyone interested can follow it as a practical guide.

* Contributions and suggestions are welcome to improve accuracy and depth.
